# Traffic Sign Classifier

## Classifying traffic sign with TensorFlow CNN architecture

In this project, a convolutional neural networks based image classfication for traffic signs is implemented.
The major technologies used in this project include: 

- Python Data Science Stack (iPython, Numpy, matplotlib) for basic data preconditioning
- OpenCV for image processing
- Scikit-learn for basic machine leanring operations such as train-test split
- TensorFlow for conducting convolutional neural networks based image classification training


Especially, the focus of this project was the CNN architecture configuration which includes the major DL concets like

- Convolution configuration for capturing features in different scale and point
- Activation function for the deep neural nets to achieve non-linearlity
- Pooling for reducing the processing data overhead without loosing the most important information
- Optimization to minimize the cross entropy
- Hyper-parameters configuration such as number of epochs and batch size
- Evaluation of the performance of the model with softmax probability

Please refer to the ipynb file for more details including actual code implementation and all results.
